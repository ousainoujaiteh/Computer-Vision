Lets create a 2D array call M to store the minimum energy value seen upto that pixel. 
If you are unfamiliar with dynamic programming, this basically says that M[i,j] will 
contain the smallest energy at that point in the image, considering all the possible 
seams upto that point from the top of the image. So, the minimum energy required to 
traverse from the top of the image to bottom will be present in the last row of M.
 We need to backtrack from this to find the list of pixels
 present in this seam, so weâ€™ll hold onto those values with a 2D array call backtrack.
